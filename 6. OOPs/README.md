# Day 6 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Today, I focused on learning the **core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.  
OOP helps in writing **reusable, modular, and maintainable** code by organizing it around **objects**.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**
   - Class â†’ A blueprint for creating objects.
   - Object â†’ An instance of a class.
   - Example: A `Car` class and objects like `car1`, `car2`.

2. **Encapsulation**
   - Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a class.
   - Achieved using **private variables** and **getter/setter methods**.

3. **Inheritance**
   - One class acquires properties & methods of another class.
   - `extends` keyword is used.
   - Promotes **code reusability**.
   - Example: `Dog` class inheriting from `Animal` class.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - One name, many forms.
   - **Compile-time (Method Overloading)** â†’ Same method name but different parameters.
   - **Runtime (Method Overriding)** â†’ Subclass provides its own implementation of a method.

5. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
   - Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
