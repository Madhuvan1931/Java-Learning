# Day 4 - Loops in Java

## ðŸ“… Learning Progress
Today I learned about **loops** in Java â€” one of the most important concepts in programming.  
Loops help us execute a block of code repeatedly without writing it multiple times.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
1. **`for` Loop**
   - Best when the number of iterations is known.
   - Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 10.
   
2. **`while` Loop**
   - Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
   - Runs until the condition becomes false.

3. **`do-while` Loop**
   - Similar to `while` loop but executes the block **at least once** before checking the condition.

4. **Nested Loops**
   - A loop inside another loop.
   - Useful for patterns, matrices, and multi-dimensional data.
