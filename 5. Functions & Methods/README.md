# Day 5 - Functions & Methods in Java

## ðŸ“… Learning Progress
Today I learned about **functions** (also called **methods** in Java).  
Functions help us organize code into reusable blocks, making programs cleaner and easier to maintain.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
1. **What is a Method?**
   - A block of code that performs a specific task.
   - Can be reused multiple times in the program.

2. **Types of Methods**
   - **Predefined (Built-in)**: Provided by Java (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`, `System.out.println()`).
   - **User-defined**: Created by the programmer.

3. **Method Syntax**
   ```java
   returnType methodName(parameters) {
       // method body
   }
