# Day 1: Variables and Data Types in Java

🎯 Goal: Understand how to declare variables and use different data types in Java.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

1. What is a variable?
2. Java primitive data types:
   - `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `long`, `short`, `byte`
3. Variable declaration and initialization
4. Constants using `final` keyword
5. Type compatibility and type casting (intro)
6. Printing variable values using `System.out.println()`

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- A **variable** is a name used to store a value that can change during program execution.
- Java is a **statically typed language**, so we must declare the type of variable before using it.
- **Primitive Data Types** are the most basic data types in Java.
